Tic Tac Toe is a common game played by children and teenagers. It is a game that requires two

players to fill in the available spots in a 3x3 grid such that a player wins once he is able to have

3 of his character all lined horizontally, vertically or diagonally while the opponent plays to

prevent the first from achieving that.
