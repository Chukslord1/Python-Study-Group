### Feedback
1. For the first question, your function was to take in 3 arguements which are the number of  seats per class. So the inputs should have been outside. That asides, it looks good.

2. This looks good too. Two things, one is that numbers greater than half of another number cannot be primes so there is no need to loop till ```num```, instead loop till num//2. Also, the part of your condition that says ```i != num``` is not necessary since the range stops at ```num -1```.

### Feedback

1. Make sure to comment your code and add a documentation string to your function for better readability. Nice logic, it was interesting to see however, it is pythonic to be as simple as possible. That said, you could have achieved the same thing with lesser lines. You may want to check out list comprehensions in python, it helps with that and has a faster computational time than regular for loops. Also, tho not explicitly stated in the question, it is good to check for possible exceptions at least from the input and take care of them (understanding that not everyone would enter what needs to be entered).


2. Again, adding a doc string is important. That asides, it looks good.
