You answered just question 1, please do better next time.
It was an interesting solution from an interesting perspective. 'Twas just long. 
Whenever you have to repeat blocks of code even if its not exactly the same, try to find a pattern (there usually is one)
and use it to create a block of code that you can loop through.
I know loops are not very attractive when you first learn about them but its important that you familiarise yourself with it.
