It is nice that you attempted all 3 questions, good job.
For question 1, I believe the issue was a misinterpretation of the question, the users are to make 3 choices based on which you show them restaurant options. Make sure to go through the corrections and listen to the accompanying audio later.
Question 2 was fine asides the skipping of the initial population which should be the population at day 1.
The aim of question 3 wasn't quite achieved. print("", end=...) should have been print(" ", end=...) so the spaces could show. From there you'd have to make sure the first one does not have a space by manipulating the numbers in the range to be (-1,numSteps -1)
Happy learning.
