##FEEDBACK
I noticed you ignored commenting throughout your
work, which made me have to read and figure out 
how your code works.
Try to practice commenting.

Also, you didn't even put and descriptive notes 
what each function in your program did.
Next time you can use triple quote (""" YOUR DESCRIPTION""")

For your is_prime function, you expected a parameter "n"
Because in your function definition I saw...


is_prime(n)

But when you called or initiated the function, you didn't
pass and parameters...
Meaning you didn't test you code or you dubbed
because you will have seen the error if you tested and didn't
dub.


When calling the function, you should have done dis...
is_prime(input("Enter a number"))

In your prime_factor function...you didn't give 
any feedback after writing to result.txt, how do you expect 
user to know if the code ran successfully or failed..
There is supposed to be a feedback message


For the readfile function, the user might not access your code, 
so how will they know the name of the file you have 
available for reading...
You are not meant to request for an input in such a case..
You should just pass the name of the file by yourself instead of 
asking user for input
