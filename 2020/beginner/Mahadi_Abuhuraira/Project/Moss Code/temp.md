A Script to decode text written in Morse code in an interactive terminal or Tkinter GUI interface.

If the decoded text is a mobile number, validation should be carried out to confirm that it is a

Nigerian number else the decoded text should just be displayed.

Morse code is an old system of communication that works based on dashes (_) and dots (.)

combinations to form encodings for the different alphabets, numbers and some special

characters. Students are to write a python module that takes in a string in morse code and

interpret it.

The result of this is then displayed. They will then be required to create an interactive terminal

display for running the program and/or a graphical user interface with the Tkinter package
