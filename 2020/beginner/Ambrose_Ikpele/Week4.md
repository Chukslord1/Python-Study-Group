### Lo Shu Magic Square

- Your code for this task had some minor bugs in it and I had to modify it before I could test it.
- Secondly, you repeated the same block of code, which I thought was not intentional, so next time review your code properly before submission.
- I liked your idea of going through each column then row and checking if their sum equals to `num`, great job on that.
- Your solution to the task is correct so good job!.
- What you could do to improve it though is to check that the numbers 1-9 each appears and appeared once in the square.

### Charge Account Validation

- Your code for this task didn't run and I had to modify it before i could test it.
- You also didn't provide the file containing the list of valid charge account numbers.
- Going through each line of the file and converting them to integers (instead of leaving that as a string) was a brilliant idea, although using a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop would have made it more obvious what you were doing.
- Your solution for this task is correct so great job on that.

### Summary

- One thing you could do to improve how you code is the way you name objects. The function `main()` why is it called that? Nothing about it is "main". Also the variable `acct` is it really an account or a list of valid account numbers? Same with `user`. The name of any object should tell you what it is at first glance.
- Your code was not able to run and I had to made some fixes. Please review your code properly before submission.
- In all, you did a great job!!!
