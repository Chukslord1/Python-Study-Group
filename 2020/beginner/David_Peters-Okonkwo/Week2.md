You've done a great job. Attempting all the questions is a good one from you. Kudos.

I have some few inputs for you though:
### Assignment 1
Your code shows that a restaurant needs to lack a dietary restriction before they can serve a person who doesn't have that dietary restriction. For instance, in the last case of your __if statement__ (before the else) it shows that the only restaurant that can serve your friends when none of them has a dietary restriction is __Joe's Gourmet Burgers__ and that should not be so. When none of your friends has a dietary restrictions, __all the restaurants__ should be able to serve them. That also applies to friends that do not have a dietary restriction in a restaurant having that restriction. They should still be able to be served there. Try to correct that in your code.

### Assignment 2 and Assignment 3
There are just minor mistakes. Just look at the result in the assignment and make your own results to look exactly like them.
