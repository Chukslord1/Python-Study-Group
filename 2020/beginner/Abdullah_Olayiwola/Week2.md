### Feedback
`
I noticed that you only attempted question 1. Please do better next time.
About the question 1, you were taking the path of hardcoding. It did not work. 
If you decide to do so next time, try to cover every possibility. 
Remember that there are 3 choices to be made and thuss you'd need 2 nested if statements not 1. In that case you would have over 10 cases which is a lot of code.
That is why loops are important. Make sure to go through the corrections.
Happy slithering.
