## FEEDBACK
I'm not sure of what you wanted to do...but I saw you 
started your program with a string...which is
wrong

I presume you want to comment of put a descriptive note
/Summary on your work...

You can do that by either:
1. Starting the sentence with #
2. Quoting the sentence with """NOTE"""

Also...you didn't answer the question proper that stated
you should try and catch errors, I inputed
alphabet where integers were expected and the code
broke...you need to study more on
TRY and EXCEPT on error handling

Also...I didn't see clearly where you defined you readline 
function or method for any class, before calling I initiating it...
You can't do that, the code will break...you need to 
define the function using...

def functionName():
    body . . .


"""then you can now initiate the function"""
functionName()

You treated name which is a variable for the user's input of the filename
as an object or class...with method readline..
So far, I didn't see any where you defined that..

Look for a solution to that, and make sure to watch out for the
correction
