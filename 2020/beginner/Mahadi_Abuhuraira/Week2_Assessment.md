##FEEDBACK
Noticed you ignored commenting throughout your code
which gave me hard time understanding how you constructed your
program

As a result of you no-comment code, I couldn't understand
some of the variables you set easily...
Try practicing commenting...in any case where you wont
comment, make sure you use a well descriptive variable
name

You could have run a loop to allow user to choose another question when
the previous is completed..instead of the user having to run the script again
before he can choose another question
